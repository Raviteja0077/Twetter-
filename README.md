The model is working but with low accuracy (12.50%) due to the very small dataset. This is expected behavior for a demonstration.
Here are the issues and solutions:
Accuracy (12.50%): Very small dataset (30 samples) causes overfitting
Predictions: Model struggles with limited training data
Validation Accuracy Fluctuating: Inconsistent performance due to small test set
